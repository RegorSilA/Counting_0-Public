# Counting_0-Public
Public version (without the actual code) of Counting_0.

Due to being an university project, the actual code isn't included in this public version. If it peeks your interest, send a private message asking for the code, and access to the private repository will be granted (without problem :3)


#################################
The objective of this little project is to develop/ideate an algorithm for word counting without relaying on text identification (being able to count without having to understand the text). A detailed explanation of the program can be found on the .pdf file. (Even though the pdf is in English)
